Why do we make maps? The first maps were likely something drawn in the dirt, or carved into a rockface. They probably consisted of a couple of sketched lines or dots; primitave in nature and simple in design. Maybe they told the user where the nearest river was or how to get to a certain cave. Today, we have hundreds of satelites orbiting the earth that can decect thousands of wavelengths, every minute giving us new data about every aspect of our planet, from global biology to disaster relif stratgies. We have interactive maps that help us understand the global economy or render the world in 3D. We have come a long way in what were mapping, but the reason why were mapping is still the same. We make maps to synthesize our exploration. Maps and exploration go hand in hand, whether it's a print map showing land value in a city or an explatory tool showing deforestation over time, the goal of the map is discovery. 200 years ago, we explored the jungle, finding the location of rivers, now we explore large datasets. Instead of trecking through the rainforest, we treck through landsat imagery. The point is the same, however, we are exploring the world.
One of the first interactive maps we made was a map of the rivers in the Louisania Purchase started by Lewis and Clark; a road map of the 19th century. It stretched out across an entire wall X by X feet. When an explorer would return from a westerly expedition, they would draw the new rivers they had found onto the map, seeing where their peice of exploration fit onto the greater map of the United States.
